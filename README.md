# Space Invaders++
Simply a more difficult, revamped version of the classic "Space Invaders"

## Motivation
Just felt like making a game, and by the time I was done testing out the basics of Pygame, I had already made the basic mechanics of Space Invaders, so I just went along with it.

## Code style
Currently no style used, but once the MVP is functional, I'll refactor the code to be much neater and object oriented so that it's much easier to edit and troubleshoot in the future.
#### NOTE: Please use flake8 linter before attempting to submit code to the repo
